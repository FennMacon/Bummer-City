            Information About Voting 
          </h3>

          <div class="blog-post">
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Voting is the most basic and obvious form of civic engagement, yet even people who have registered to vote fail to turn up at their polling place on election day.</p> 

            <p style="text-indent: 40px">In Boston, a paltry 66.75% of registered voters cast ballots in the November 2016 General Election (which, of course, was a Presidential election); in the November 2017 General Election (an exclusively municipal election) that number dropped to 27.8% of registered voters in the city; in the May 2018 Special State Election for a State Senate seat an astounding 4.24% of Boston voters cast ballots. Believe it or not, these numbers are impressive when compared with national voter turnout averages.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px">So why do so many people choose not to vote? Why do so many people fail to even register to vote? There are many culprits, but a major one is general confusion about the process. We are here to clear some things up for you. </p>  
            <ul><li><b>Voter Registration</b></li></ul>
           		<ul><ul><li>In order to vote, you need to be registered. <u>Registration is based on your home address</u>, as in the place where you live. It does not matter if you have an out-of-state driver's license or whatever else. If you are a student and you live in a dorm in Boston, your dorm is your mailing address and you can use that to register to vote in Massachusetts. As long as you receive mail at the address and actually live there, you're all set. You can register online if you have a MA state ID, otherwise you need to register with the mail-in form. 
                  <li><a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ovr/">Register to vote here (MA folks only)</a></li>
                 <li><a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/Voter-reg-mail-in.pdf">Download a mail-in voter registration form here (MA folks only)</a> </li></ul></ul>
            <ul><li><b>Where do I go to vote?</b></li></ul>
            <ul><ul><li>This is connected to your registration: Your <u>polling place</u> (the physical location where you go to vote) is determined based on the address where you are registered. There are likely dozens of different polling places in your city or town, but you need to figure out which one is yours. This is also why it is so important to re-register to vote each time you move; your polling place will probably change.</li>

          <ul><li><b>Who is allowed to vote?</b></li></ul>
            <ul><ul><li>Anyone who is...</ul></ul>
            <ul><ul><ul><li> 1.) A US Citizen</li> 
              <li>2.) A resident of a given state (Massachusetts in our case)</li>
              <li>3.) 18 years old (16 year olds can pre-register in Massachusetts and will automatically be added to the voter rolls upon turning 18)</li>
              <li><b>IN MASSACHUSETTS YOU NEED TO BE REGISTERED <u>20 DAYS BEFORE AN ELECTION</u> IN ORDER TO VOTE</b></li></ul></ul></ul>
            <ul><li><b>How do I get an absentee ballot?</b></li></ul>
            <ul><ul><li>If you will be unable to physically get to your polling place on election day (either because you are out of town or because of work schedule constraints or whatever else) you can get an absentee ballot which you can submit by mail.

          <p> Sometimes you don't have time to do all of the research on your own, and that's okay! For those of you who are not entirely sure who you want to vote for, who are looking for some guidance, here are our suggestions. These are in no way authoritative; they are merely the endorsements that the Bummer City team landed on after deliberation.  </p>
